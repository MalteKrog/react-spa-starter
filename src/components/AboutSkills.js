                    <p className="home-tekst">Hello! My name is Malte and I love making websites, and everything around it. My love for PCs and things on the web started back in 2016. I have been a professional Esports trainer and analytic for 5 years now, and part of my job was to create systems, that would automatically update data from an API to excel sheets. That is when I realized just how fun and creative you can be, when creating on the web. <br></br><br></br>
Fast-forward to today, and I am currently studying on <i>Erhvervsakadamiet Aarhus</i> as a<i> Multimedie-designer</i>. I am also co-founder of <i>Next Level Media</i>, with the focus on website making, and the content around it. <br></br><br></br>
Recently I been learning React and the usage of Headless CMS.<br></br><br></br>
Here are a few technologies I have been working with lately:
